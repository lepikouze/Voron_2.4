# common-macros

A collection of the macros common to all my printers running Klipper.  More machine-specific macros are available in my [V0 1850](https://github.com/martinbranda/Voron_V0) and [V2.4 4098](https://github.com/martinbranda/Voron_2.4) configs.

Feel free to use anything you find here, but remember, if it breaks, you get to keep the pieces.
