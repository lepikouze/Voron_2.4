# v2-4098 config

This is the Klipper configuration for my Voron V2.4, V2-4098.

It uses my [common macros](https://github.com/martinbranda/common-macros) too, which are shared with [V0 1850](https://github.com/martinbranda/Voron_V0), my Voron V0.

Feel free to use anything you find here, but remember, if it breaks, you get to keep the pieces.
